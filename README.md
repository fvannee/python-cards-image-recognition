# python-cards-image-recognition
This repository contains software for image recognition of playing cards. The software is sophisticated enough to recognize even cases when multiple cards are in one image and when cards are partially covering each other.

This directory contains the program written in Python which can be used to train the image recognition software.

Requirements:
- OpenCV 3.2
- Python 3
